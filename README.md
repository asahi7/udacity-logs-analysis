# Logs Analysis

### Project Design

The program executes three PostgreSQL queries in sequence and outputs results for each of them.

Specifically will output:
* What are the most popular three articles of all time? 
* Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
* On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

### To Run:

`python3 news.py`
